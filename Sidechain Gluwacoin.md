## Preamble

    Title: Sidechain Gluwacoin Standard
    Author: Tae Lim Oh <taelim.oh@gluwa.com>
    Type: Standard
    Created: 2020-10-19


## Simple Summary

A standard interface for 2-way pegged [Gluwacoin](https://gluwacoin.com) deployed on a sidechain.


## Abstract

The following standard allows the implementation of a standard API for Gluwacoin with two gatekeepers: Gluwa and Luniverse.
A user on the Ethereum network can peg his or her Gluwacoin to a gateway contract.
Gatekeepers verify if Gluwacoin is pegged on the Ethereum network.
If both Gatekeepers approves the peg, Gluwa can mint the Gluwacoin to the user on Luniverse.
The user can burn his or her balance when wants to return to the Ethereum network.
The user will submit the transaction ID of the burn to the gateway contract on the Ethereum network.
This standard is Gluwacoin compatible, and, thus, ERC-20 compliant.


## Motivation

A standard interface to add any sidechain to the Gluwa ecosystem.

Gluwacoin Standard has extended on ERC-20 to enhance usability.
ETHless transfer freed users from buying Ether before they can start using a dapp.
Non-custodial exchange functions allow users to make exchange without giving up custody of their fund 
and access a pool of orders instead of taking a whole order at a time.
Again, without buying Ether.
Also, [Gluwa](https://gluwa.com) provides a suite of web services to ease on-boarding,
including [REST API](https://docs.gluwa.com/api/api), 
mobile apps ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/gluwa/id1021292326), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gluwa.android)), 
and [dashboard](https://dashboard.gluwa.com/).
